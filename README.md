# asset-allocation-modeling

Goals: 

build different asset allocation models (Based off _Optimal Versus Naive Diversification: How Inefficient is the 1 / N Portfolio Strategy?_ Paper by DeMiguel, Garlappi, Uppal) to learn how risk and reward are balanced in portfolios, practice implementing research papers in code, as well as learning how to model future events into distributions, which I'll then sample out to test a trading model. 

Planning to test this with classic linear models to non linear Bayesian models with priors and see their weaknesses and strengths.

Will also lead to experience with: backtesting my results, what to do with biased data, time series biases, Sharpe ratios performance for linear models and non linear models, potentially derive unique risk adjusted performance measurement aside from standard deviation and Sharpe.

Ultimately building an intuition for what drives movement of stock and bonds and how they're related to each other, the effect of frequent trades (costs), and how volume impacts price movements.
